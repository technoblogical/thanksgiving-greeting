_Some jQuery that displays a message on a webpage if it's Thanksgiving.<br/>

I built this for a thanksgiving message accros my social media. I didn't make it work there, I just wanted a screenshot of the code. I did it mostly as an exercise and for fun. It had been too long since I had uploaded something to GitHub.


##How Does This Thing Work?
Just link to the javascript file after you close the BODY tag. (Your webpage will need to reference jQuery somewhere.)
